I work as a junior researcher in bioinformatics at the Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, and as a researcher in Quretec ltd., Estonia.My work is largely related to design, implementation and maintenance of the databases and tools infrastructure.My research examines the integration of data mining, network modelling and systems biology approach to various range of biological questions.I have experience in teaching various courses at the University of Tartu, and in organising workshops about data analysis tools for biologists.
